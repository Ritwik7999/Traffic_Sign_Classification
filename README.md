# Traffic Sign Recognition using Deep Learning
In this project the computer recognizes the image that has been given to it. The ability to recognize a image by the computer was the main goal by this project. As we know that the computer does not understand images therefore these images are taken in the form of pixels or matrices. After this these images are fed into the neural network. The neural network are broken into layers .The first layer in the neural network is termed as input layer where the images from the dataset are taken. The second layers or the forth coming layers or the layers between are termed as hidden layers. The last layer is the output layer The output layer decides whether the input image entered from the dataset in correctly recognized by the machine or not.Pooling is same as convolution but no hyperparameters are there
unlike convolution. As there are so many classes or output labels are therefore SoftMax function is used. SoftMax function basically predicts the suitable label for the input image
